# go-to-recipes app
## Dan McKeon

# Description

This week at Dev Bootcamp, we learned how Ruby can interact with SQL databases. This app is meant to be an exploration of that functionality. I seeded the database with a few of my favorite recipes. Users can access one or multiple recipes and the app will generate a single grocery list that encapsulates all the recipes.

# Instructions

Ensure you have sqlite3 gem installed to run this application
First run ruby seeds.rb to seed the database
Then run ruby recipes.rb to access user interface
