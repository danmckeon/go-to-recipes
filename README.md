# go-to-recipes app
## Dan McKeon

# Description

We recently learned how Ruby can interact with SQL databases and this app is meant to be an exploration of this functionality. I put a few of my favorite recipes on here and the app is meant to easily create a grocery list for each recipe. Users are able to access database items.

...DELETE?

# Instructions

Ensure you have sqlite3 gem installed to run this application
First run ruby seeds.rb to seed the database
Then run ruby recipes.rb to access user interface
